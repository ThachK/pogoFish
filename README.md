# pogoFish
PogoFish is a simple android application. The main objective of the game is to collect coins or trophies while avoiding obstacles for as long as you can; the more coins you collect, the higher your score. 

Note: This is not the full Kotlin/Java build, only the source code for the game and its entities.
